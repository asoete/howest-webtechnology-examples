	<p>
	Cytosine (/ˈsaɪtəˌsiːn, -ˌziːn, -ˌsɪn/;C) is one of the four main bases
	found in DNA and RNA, along with adenine, guanine, and thymine (uracil in
	RNA). It is a pyrimidine derivative, with a heterocyclic aromatic ring
	and two substituents attached (an amine group at position 4 and a keto
	group at position 2). The nucleoside of cytosine is cytidine. In
	Watson-Crick base pairing, it forms three(3) hydrogen bonds with guanine.
